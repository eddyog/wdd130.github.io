            <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
            <p class='apple_p'>This is a good example of Alignment because it allows us to read and understand easly 
                the main purpose of the website. In this case they are giving a tribute to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr
                that is the purpose of the color to to understand more their point 
                Alignment allows an observer to read the image more easily and clearly. 
                This is achieved by aligning objects to establish order 
                and avoid haphazardly positioning items in the image.

            <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
            <p class='testla_p'>We can appreciate the contrast in the image from differenthigns 
            for example the use of the color red. It is a supercar and the red makes
            to get the attention of the reader to get the perseption of speed 
            Contrast compels the observer to notice important details within the work. 
            Through size, color, or content, contrast attracts the viewer 
             to see two or more objects disagreeing or even conflicting in the image.</p>

            <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
                <p class='glasses_p'>The important of Repetition in different ways makes a website to get 
                the attention of the reader in different forms. In this case the purpose is 
                to sell the customer glasses so they are going to use repetition in different styles 
                to get the attention of the client 
                Repetition also gives the image order from repeated use of the same fonts, colors, layouts. 
                This helps to orientate the viewer and also subtly show how  
                certain ideas may be emphasized through reappearances of the same or a similar object.</p>
