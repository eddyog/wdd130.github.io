                    <h2>Welcome to Temple Inn & Suites</h2>
                    <p>President Gordon B Hinkley said of Temples, “This is a place of light, a place of peace, a place of
                        love, where we deal with the things of eternity.” And certainly, his words cannot be denied. All people who
                        have ever visited the Temple can testify of the sweet spirit and peace that they feel there. Yet,
                        many have to travel great distances to come and partake in the spirit of this great work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our vision at Temple Inn and Suites is to make your stay as comfortable and stress free as
                        possible--whether you come for a few days to participate in a family members'
                        wedding, or many months and even years as you serve as a Temple Worker. We are conveniently
                        located just outside Temple grounds in select locations to make your commute as short as possible. 
                        Please visit our guest portal to learn more about accomodations and services at a Temple Inn near you.</p>
